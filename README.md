*Multiple shapes generated using PySTL as STL file and visualized in **Meshmixer** for the purpose of this picture. The visualization in PySTL can be done using pyvista*

### Use python to programatically create stereolithographic (stl) files of regular geometric shapes

Pystl can be used for the following purposes:
- to create simple geometric shape files in .stl format.
- visualize this stl files. [PySTL uses pyvista for such visualizations].
- perform simple transformations like translate, rotate and scale shapes.

*Pystl is an open source project that welcomes contributions from developers from diverse community and backgrounds.*
